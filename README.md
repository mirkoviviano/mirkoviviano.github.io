## Overview

I am currently working on my portfolio, whose static version, can be found here https://mirkoviviano.github.io/. 

## About me
My name is Mirko, and I am a developer.
My approach to technologiesâ€™ world started the day my father brought home a computer. Since then, I did not even know what a computer was, but my great passion for technologies started in that precise moment. My passion grew up and from that moment I have been studying computer science on my own, until the first day at University.
